## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

It's challenging to fade a background color and icon over an image.

### Continued development

Around the corners of the image, there is some background color artifacting happening on the rounded edges. I'd like to find a solution to this issue.
